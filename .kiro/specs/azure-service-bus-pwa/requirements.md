# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This document outlines the requirements for a Progressive Web Application (PWA) that serves as a comprehensive Azure Service Bus Explorer with advanced JSON analytics capabilities. The application will be built using React 18+, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, and Shadcn/ui components, featuring an ASCII/command-line inspired design aesthetic while maintaining modern usability through button-based interactions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Service Bus Operations

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to perform comprehensive Azure Service Bus operations, so that I can effectively manage and monitor my message queues and topics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN I connect to Azure Service Bus THEN the system SHALL support both connection strings and Azure AD authentication
2. WHEN I select a queue or topic THEN the system SHALL display real-time message statistics and metadata
3. WHEN I peek messages THEN the system SHALL retrieve messages non-destructively with pagination support
4. WHEN I receive messages THEN the system SHALL remove messages from the queue with confirmation dialogs
5. WHEN I delete messages THEN the system SHALL provide batch operations with safety confirmations
6. WHEN I send messages THEN the system SHALL support custom properties, session IDs, and message scheduling
7. WHEN I access dead letter queues THEN the system SHALL provide specialized handling and reprocessing options

### Requirement 2: Advanced JSON Analytics

**User Story:** As a data analyst, I want to analyze JSON message payloads in real-time, so that I can understand message patterns and identify traffic characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN messages are loaded THEN the system SHALL automatically parse and analyze JSON structures
2. WHEN analyzing fields THEN the system SHALL provide frequency analysis for each JSON field path
3. WHEN viewing field statistics THEN the system SHALL show data types, unique values, and coverage percentages
4. WHEN filtering messages THEN the system SHALL support complex queries based on JSON field values
5. WHEN tracking patterns THEN the system SHALL identify message origins and correlation patterns
6. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL support JSON, CSV, and analytics report formats
7. WHEN processing large datasets THEN the system SHALL maintain performance with 10,000+ messages

### Requirement 3: High-Performance Message Handling

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to handle large volumes of messages efficiently, so that I can monitor high-throughput systems without performance degradation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN loading messages THEN the system SHALL use virtualized lists for rendering performance
2. WHEN processing JSON THEN the system SHALL use web workers for non-blocking analysis
3. WHEN updating UI THEN the system SHALL implement optimistic updates for responsive interactions
4. WHEN managing memory THEN the system SHALL implement intelligent caching and cleanup strategies
5. WHEN handling real-time updates THEN the system SHALL batch updates to prevent UI thrashing
6. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use efficient data structures optimized for search and analysis

### Requirement 4: Secure Credential Management

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want to securely store my Azure Service Bus connection strings and credentials, so that I can access my resources without compromising security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt connection strings using Web Crypto API
2. WHEN managing connections THEN the system SHALL support multiple named connection profiles
3. WHEN authenticating THEN the system SHALL support Azure AD integration with MSAL
4. WHEN accessing stored data THEN the system SHALL require user authentication or device unlock
5. WHEN exporting settings THEN the system SHALL exclude sensitive credentials from exports
6. WHEN clearing data THEN the system SHALL provide secure deletion of all stored credentials

### Requirement 5: Progressive Web App Capabilities

**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want to install and use the application offline, so that I can access my message analysis tools anywhere.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN installing THEN the system SHALL be installable as a PWA on desktop and mobile devices
2. WHEN offline THEN the system SHALL provide cached message analysis and basic functionality
3. WHEN reconnecting THEN the system SHALL sync pending operations and refresh data
4. WHEN using mobile THEN the system SHALL provide responsive design optimized for touch interfaces
5. WHEN receiving updates THEN the system SHALL notify users of new versions and update seamlessly
6. WHEN storing data THEN the system SHALL use IndexedDB for persistent local storage

### Requirement 6: ASCII/Command-Line Aesthetic

**User Story:** As a developer who appreciates terminal interfaces, I want a command-line inspired design, so that I feel comfortable and productive in a familiar aesthetic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN viewing the interface THEN the system SHALL use monospace fonts and terminal color schemes
2. WHEN interacting with elements THEN the system SHALL provide button-based interactions with CLI-style feedback
3. WHEN displaying data THEN the system SHALL use ASCII art elements and box-drawing characters
4. WHEN showing status THEN the system SHALL use terminal-style status indicators and progress bars
5. WHEN providing feedback THEN the system SHALL use command-line style notifications and confirmations
6. WHEN theming THEN the system SHALL support multiple terminal color schemes (green, amber, blue)

### Requirement 7: Modular Chirpstack Integration

**User Story:** As a Chirpstack administrator, I want separate but integrated gateway monitoring capabilities, so that I can manage both Service Bus and Chirpstack from one application.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN accessing Chirpstack features THEN the system SHALL provide a separate module with distinct navigation
2. WHEN monitoring gateways THEN the system SHALL display real-time status and location mapping
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN the system SHALL provide gateway statistics and historical data
4. WHEN configuring THEN the system SHALL store Chirpstack credentials separately from Service Bus
5. WHEN switching modules THEN the system SHALL maintain independent state and settings
6. WHEN sharing data THEN the system SHALL allow correlation between Service Bus messages and gateway events

### Requirement 8: Data Export and Reporting

**User Story:** As a business analyst, I want to export message data and analytics reports, so that I can share insights with stakeholders and integrate with other tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN exporting messages THEN the system SHALL support filtered exports with custom date ranges
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL create analytics summaries with visualizations
3. WHEN sharing data THEN the system SHALL support multiple formats (JSON, CSV, PDF reports)
4. WHEN scheduling exports THEN the system SHALL provide automated export capabilities
5. WHEN customizing reports THEN the system SHALL allow template-based report generation
6. WHEN protecting data THEN the system SHALL sanitize exports to remove sensitive information
